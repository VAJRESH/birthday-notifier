# birthday-notifier

## Aim
- An intro to [MERN Stack]() and understanding how each technology fits together before learning them deeply.

## General Info
- Birthday Notifier is a responsive website. You can visit it [here]().
- I have added a register and login system to the website. For registration you need to enter a secret token which is only known by me.(I don't have have enough storage in [mongodb]() for multiple users as I use free tier)
- Without logging in, as of now, you can see all my entires and can perform search by name.
- Once logged in, perform basic [CRUD actions]() like adding, deleting, editing entries.
- The entries get sorted according to the latest upcoming birthdays.
- A 'Happy Birthday!!' message is displayed if someones birthday is today after pressing on update list button that day. I planned to do this staff automatic but [heroku]() doesn't support cron jobs from my files and since I didn't add card details I can't add [heroku addons]().
