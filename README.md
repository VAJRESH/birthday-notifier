# birthday-notifier

## Aim
- An intro to [MERN Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/) and understanding how each technology fits together before learning them deeply.

## General Info
- Birthday Notifier is a responsive website. You can visit it [here](https://birthday-notifier00.herokuapp.com/).
- Once logged in, perform basic [CRUD actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) like adding, deleting, editing entries.
- The entries get sorted according to the latest upcoming birthdays.
- A 'Happy Birthday!!' message is displayed if someones birthday is today after pressing on update list button that day. I planned to do this staff automatic but [heroku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku) doesn't support cron jobs from my files and since I didn't add card details I can't add [heroku addons](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/add-ons).
